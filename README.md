GitQlient, pronounced as git+client (/gɪtˈklaɪənt/) is a multi-platform Git
client originally forked from QGit. Nowadays it goes beyond of just a fork and
adds a lot of new functionality.

## User Manual

Please, if you have any doubts about how to use it or you just want to know all you can do with GitQlient, take a look to [the user manual in here](https://francescmm.github.io/GitQlient).

It is planned to release for Linux, MacOs and Windows. However, take into account that the development environment is based on Linux and it will be the first platform released.

## Development documentation

I'm aware that developers may like to have some more information beyond the User Manual. Whether you want to collaborate in the development or just to know how GitQlient works I think it's nice to have some development documentation. In the [Wiki section](https://github.com/francescmm/GitQlient/wiki) I will release class diagramas, sequence diagrams as well as the Release Plan an features. Take a look!
